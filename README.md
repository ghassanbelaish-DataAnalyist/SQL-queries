# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## 1. Introduction
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

**Key Business Problem:**
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy.

**My Role:**
I practiced as a data analyst in Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service as a part of my CAREERFOUNDRY data analysis program.

## 2. Key Questions & Objectives
The management team needed data-driven answers to the following questions for their 2020 strategy:

* **Revenue:** Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* **Rental Duration:** What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* **Customer Geography:** Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* **Lifetime Value:** Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* **Sales Variation:** Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## 3. Data & Tools
**Rockbuster Data Set:**
The data set contains information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments.

**Technical Skills Demonstrated:**
* **Relational Database Management (RDBMS):** Loaded Rockbuster’s data into a PostgreSQL database.
* **SQL (PostgreSQL):** Used for in-depth analysis. Skills applied include:
    * Joins & Subqueries
    * Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
    * Filtering (WHERE/HAVING) and Aggregations
    * Data Cleaning & Summarizing
* **Visualization:** Created maps and charts using Excel and Tableau to present findings to stakeholders.

## 4. Key Findings
After analyzing the data using SQL, I identified several critical insights for the 2020 strategy:

* [cite_start]**Global Revenue Leaders:** The top 10 countries for revenue are dominated by **India and China**, followed by the USA, Brazil, and Russia[cite: 227]. These markets represent the largest customer base.
* **The "Loyalty Gap":** While **China** drives high sales volume, it has **zero** customers in the "Top 10 Loyal Customers" list. [cite_start]High-lifetime-value customers are primarily located in the **USA and Canada**[cite: 272, 273].
* [cite_start]**Content Preferences:** "Sports" is the undisputed leading category worldwide in terms of both sales and popularity[cite: 263].
* [cite_start]**Top Movie:** The highest-grossing movie is *"Telegraph Voyage"*, which also has the longest rental duration[cite: 260].

## 5. Visualizations

[cite_start]The analysis showed a clear correlation between our fan base size and sales consistency across regions, particularly in Asia[cite: 250].

## 6. Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommended the following actions to the Management Board:

1.  [cite_start]**Launch a Reward Program in China:** Since China has high volume but low loyalty, pilot a "Rockbuster Rewards" program there to incentivize repeat rentals and increase customer lifetime value[cite: 278].
2.  [cite_start]**Content Acquisition Strategy:** Focus on acquiring more titles in the **"Sports"** category, as it is the top performer globally[cite: 281].
3.  [cite_start]**Promote Top Titles:** Feature *"Telegraph Voyage"* and *"Zorro Ark"* on regional homepages to maximize revenue from proven hits[cite: 282].
